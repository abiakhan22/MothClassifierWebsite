Hi, my name is Alicia Montgomery. Not only am I a Computer Science Major at GW, I am also pursuing a minor in Fine Arts. I have a passion for creating, from coding new programs to painting a figure to working a laser printer, I enjoy anything that involves making something new. I also love playing video games, catching up with my favorite shows, and working out (when time permits). In the future, I would love (and am currently trying) to work as either a UX/UI Designer or a Mobile App Developer.
